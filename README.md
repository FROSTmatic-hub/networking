# Networking — Week 1 Labs

**Owner:** FROSTmatic-hub (Shaafi)  
**Focus:** Network/Infrastructure pentesting — reconnaissance & basic exploitation labs.

## Overview
This repository contains my beginner-to-intermediate labs and notes for network penetration testing. It documents my Week 1 work: networking fundamentals, ARP discovery, packet captures, `nmap` reconnaissance, basic Linux usage, Metasploit workflow, and a safe EternalBlue lab performed in an isolated VM environment.

## Contents
- `networking/note-day1.md` - Day 1: ARP discovery & ping (with screenshot).  
- `images/` - Screenshots for Days.
- `outputs/` - Detailed outputs of scan in Text Format.

## How to use this repo
- Read the markdown files for step-by-step commands, findings, and remediation notes.
- All labs were executed in isolated VMs under authorized lab conditions only.

I’m actively building more labs (nmap deep dives, privilege escalation, pivoting). Open to internships or junior pentester roles — connect with me on LinkedIn.
